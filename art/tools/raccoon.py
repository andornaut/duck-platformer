"""The climbing raccoon antagonist, separate from the retained pedestrian/room cast.

Usage, from the repository root:
  python3 -I art/tools/raccoon.py build
  python3 -I art/tools/raccoon.py preview OUT.png

raccoon-antagonist: 48x48, facing right in a three-quarter front view; mirrored for left. Fixed frame-bottom
centre (24,48), feet on row46 with outline on47 when standing. Every limb and the banded tail stay inside
hitbox (2,2,44,46) for all poses. Contact is always lethal; no red contact outline is baked into the art.

The round grey head, cream face band, paired ink masks, rounded ears and thick banded tail identify the
animal. Grey fur has slate crescents and lgrey rims; the muzzle and belly are cream. A closed navy/ink
outline keeps the silhouette readable against industrial lavender. No clothing, names, portraits or teeth.

Tags, in frame order:
- idle: 2x400ms, quiet breathing, paws lowered, feet planted.
- climb: 4x120ms, opposite paws grip at alternating heights, opposite feet rise, torso lifts on passing poses.
- prepare: 1x400ms, visibly compressed and tense before the drop, paws held against the torso.
- drop: 2x100ms, splayed limbs then tucked paws and feet during descent.
- rest: 2x400ms, settled after landing; still lethal, never a safe state.

All tags loop. The generic behaviour state machine owns state timing and physical movement; frame durations
are art cycle defaults. Build writes art/antagonists/raccoon-antagonist.aseprite and its PNG/JSON export.
