"""Zone 1 art: a New York street (downtown on a pale steel morning, two screens tall, climbed into its upper
screen), and the boutique lobby kept for a later indoor zone, as 12px tilesets and modular backdrop pieces that the
game places from level data. Nothing here is a fixed panorama.

Usage:
  floor1.py build             write public/art/tilesets/<key>.png + .json and public/art/backdrops/<key>.png, and
                              list them in the manifest under "tilesets" and "backdrops"
  floor1.py preview OUT.png   an example street column and an example lobby, each 720x720 (two screens tall),
                              beside both tilesets at 4x, composed from the pieces with the duck and
                              the touch buttons

Run from the repository root.

Scale
- Outdoors the world is drawn as if zoomed out 4x while the duck and the 12px tiles keep their size: a storey is
  180px and a door is about 45px, so the duck (42px) stands almost as tall as a street door. The street is 720px
  (60 tiles) tall: the sidewalk's top is y 600 (row 50) with 10 rows of sidewalk and road below it, the ground
  storey runs from y 420 to it, and storeys stack every 180px above (a three-storey walk-up's roof is at y 60,
  row 5). Indoors (the lobby) is a separate scene at full scale, also 720px tall, its floor at y 672.

Palette (the street; the lobby keeps its own)
- A pale steel atmosphere: flat lgrey sky, grey window-free distant skyline and sparse slate middle-distance
  buildings. The two city layers repeat at 720px and stay separate for parallax. Near facades and shopfronts use
  slate, dslate and grey, with quiet windows. Cream icons, ochre awnings and amber room doors provide warm accents.
- street-city-far: 720x600, bottom y 600, repeat x; suggested horizontal scroll factor 0.15.
- street-city-mid: 720x600, bottom y 600, repeat x; suggested horizontal scroll factor 0.4.
- street-sky stays fixed; near facades, storefronts, doors, ledges and attached props share gameplay motion.
- street-skyline remains a 336x600 combined fallback. Use it or the separate city layers, never both.

Tilesets
- A tileset is one PNG of 12x12 tiles in rows of COLUMNS (8), no spacing or margin, transparent where a tile has no
  art, and a JSON beside it:
    {"tileSize": 12, "columns": 8,
     "tiles": {"<name>": <index>, ...},                  index = row * columns + column, every tile named
     "pieces": {"<name>": [[<index>, ...], ...]}}        multi-tile pieces as rows of indices, top row first
  Names are kebab-case. A tile whose name starts with "one-way-" is a one-way ledge: it stops a fall onto its top
  edge and nothing else. A tile whose name starts with "door-" or "exit-" is a doorway: it has no collision, and
  where the level gives it a room, the game puts a Use zone over its piece. A tile whose name starts with "pit-"
  is a pit: it has no collision, so she falls through it and out of the level. Every other tile with art is solid
  on all sides.
- The manifest lists each as {"key": "<key>", "png": "tilesets/<key>.png", "json": "tilesets/<key>.json"}.
- Walkable surfaces: the walkable edge is the tile's top row. A surface tile has a 1px edge, a 2px light lip and
  a 2px darker underside; the face tiles below it are plainer and darker.

tiles-street
- sidewalk-top, sidewalk-top-joint (a 2px slab joint at the right edge; alternate them, 24px rhythm),
  sidewalk-top-left, sidewalk-top-right (plain ends, over a drop), kerb-left, kerb-right (a pale stone kerb where
  the sidewalk meets a cross street, one tile above the road), sidewalk-face, sidewalk-face-left,
  sidewalk-face-right: pale concrete (white lip, lgrey slabs) over a slate face.
- road-top, road: asphalt, one tile below the sidewalk.
- one-way-awning-left, one-way-awning, one-way-awning-right: an ochre-and-cream shop awning seen front-on, 4px
  stripes and a scalloped hem, art in the top 11 rows. Lay them on row 20 (y 240), 6 tiles above the sidewalk,
  across a shopfront under its sign.
- one-way-canopy-left, one-way-canopy, one-way-canopy-right: a dark-brown canopy with a white lip, the same shape,
  laid on row 20 over the hotel door.
- planter-top-left, planter-top, planter-top-right (a clipped hedge: the walkable top), planter-left, planter,
  planter-right (the box). A planter is 2 tiles tall: a 2-tile step.
- door (piece, 3x4 tiles, 36x48): a pair of lit amber glass doors in a slate frame, a room's door
  where the level has one. Tiles door-0 to door-11 in row order; no collision.
- The cellar hatch, a hazard: an open pit in the sidewalk, any number of tiles wide, its two steel leaves standing
  up. On the sidewalk row: hatch-left, then pit-opening for each opening tile, then hatch-right. pit-opening fills
  every row below the opening to the level's bottom, and sidewalk-face-right and sidewalk-face-left run down under
  the two edges. pit-leaf-left-top over pit-leaf-left stand on the two rows above hatch-left, pit-leaf-right-top
  over pit-leaf-right above hatch-right. hatch-left and hatch-right are solid sidewalk ends capped by a steel angle
  iron; pit-opening is the dark drop (ink); the leaves are slate plates with dslate studs, 20px tall, leaning
  outwards, with no collision. Steel is the slate ramp (slate, dslate, navy), no grey. Tiles 35 to 41, after the
  door, so every earlier index holds.
- Climbing, tiles 42 to 53, after the hatch, so every earlier index holds. One-way ledges, each with left, middle
  and right tiles, laid any width at the reaches (a hop rises 3 tiles, a full jump 8); every top has a 2px white
  lip under a 1px dark edge, so it reads against any facade in greyscale:
  one-way-fire-escape-* (a black iron landing, art in the top 7 rows; stand fire-escape-railing on it and run
  fire-escape-ladder up to the next landing, a few tiles and at most 8 above), one-way-sill-* (a stone window sill,
  2 or 3 wide, art in the top 7 rows, its top on a window's sill line), one-way-cornice-* (a rooftop cornice with
  dentils, the full tile, along a roofline's top edge), one-way-tank-* (a water tower's flat top, 4 wide on the
  water-tower piece's second tile row, 6 tiles above its roof).

tiles-lobby (the boutique lobby: wood, books and plants, at indoor scale; kept for a later indoor zone)
- Every walkable top, the floor and each one-way ledge, has the same 2px cream lip under a 1px plum edge, so the
  standable edges are the brightest lines in the room, in colour and in greyscale.
- floor-top, floor-top-joint (a 2px board end at the right edge; alternate them, 24px rhythm), floor-top-left,
  floor-top-right, floor-face, floor-face-left, floor-face-right: brown boards over a dark-brown face. The lobby
  floor line is y 672 (row 56) in a level 720px (60 tiles) tall.
- One-way ledges, each a 7px slab (left, middle, right): one-way-balcony-* (the mezzanine's front edge),
  one-way-shelf-* (bookcase boards, with brackets on the end tiles), one-way-cushion-* (the sofa's seat and back),
  one-way-desk-* (the reception desk's top).
- post-cap-left/right, post-left/right, post-base-left/right: a wood post 2 tiles wide, solid, for the room's
  ends.
- exit (piece, 7x15 tiles, 84x180, a door at indoor scale): a stairwell, an opening with stairs rising to the
  right under a white up-arrow on a green sign. Tiles exit-0 to exit-104 in row order; no collision.

Backdrops
- One PNG per piece in public/art/backdrops/<key>.png, drawn behind the play layer, lower in contrast and
  saturation than the tiles. The manifest lists each as
    {"key": "<key>", "png": "backdrops/<key>.png", "width": w, "height": h, "anchor": "bottom-left", "y": y,
     "repeat": "x" | "none"}
  The piece's bottom-left corner sits at world y (its bottom edge), at an x the level data chooses. "repeat": "x"
  tiles it horizontally across a run; "none" places it once. Street y values are in the two-screen frame (the
  sidewalk's top at y 600, row 50); the sidewalk and road tiles fill rows 50 to 59 below it. Draw order, back to front: sky, skyline, facades and
  their upper storeys and rooflines, facade pieces, storefronts, street furniture, then the play layer.
- Sky and city (repeat x): street-sky 48x600 (y 600), flat lgrey. street-city-far and street-city-mid are each
  720x600 (y 600), window-free grey and slate silhouettes. street-skyline 336x600 is their combined fallback.
- Facades (repeat x, one per building type; a run per building): facade-one-storey 48x192 (y 600, a parapet 192
  up), facade-walkup 48x312, facade-brownstone 48x312, facade-hotel 48x312 (y 600 each). Each shows the 180px
  ground storey with a band over the shopfronts and the next storey's windows above, up to y 288.
- Upper storeys and rooflines (repeat x): facade-walkup-upper, facade-brownstone-upper, facade-hotel-upper, each
  48x180, stack above the facade piece every 180px (bottoms at y 288, then 108) with no seam;
  roofline-walkup, roofline-brownstone, roofline-hotel, each 48x48, cap the topmost piece (bottom at its top), so
  the roof is 48px above it (y 240, row 20, on a facade piece; y 60, row 5, on one upper storey, the tallest that
  fits). Lay one-way-cornice along it. A water tower (its tank top 6 tiles above its roof) fits on a two-storey roof
  (tank top row 14), not on a three-storey one.
- Facade pieces (none): fire-escape 196x185 (y 473, on a walk-up), hotel-crest 98x44 (y 478, over the door: two
  banners and the crest), hotel-window 32x152 (y 592, a tall window). The tall dark stone building and these
  pieces are generic until the exit is decided.
- Climbing (backdrop, no collision): fire-escape-railing 48x24 (repeat x, its bottom on a landing's top),
  fire-escape-ladder 24x96 (none, 2x8 tiles) and fire-escape-ladder-4, -5, -6, -7 (24x48 to 24x84, 2x4 to
  2x7 tiles): one per landing spacing in rows; place the one matching the spacing with its bottom on the lower
  landing's top (y = lower row * 12), so its top meets the upper landing; water-tower 48x84 (none,
  4x7 tiles, its bottom on a roof; one-way-tank tiles on its second tile row).
- Storefronts (none), each 120 tall (y 600), a whole number of tiles wide, with a sign icon (never text), a tall
  display window and a 46px door: storefront-cafe 84, storefront-florist 84, storefront-gift-shop 96,
  storefront-makeup-store 96, storefront-pet-shop 108, storefront-diner 108, storefront-noodle-bar 120.
- Street furniture (none, y 600): cab 96x40, hot-dog-cart 40x70, subway-railing 72x62, street-tree 64x136,
  walk-signal 12x82, doorman-podium 18x24, canopy-poles 60x60 (under the canopy's end tiles), cross-street
  120x26 (the far avenue between two kerbs; place no facade over a cross street so the skyline shows).
- Lobby (kept for a later indoor zone; indoor scale, the floor line is y 672): lobby-wall 48x720 (y 720, x: wood panelling, cornice,
  wainscot), lobby-balustrade 48x36 (y at the balcony's floor line, x), lobby-bookcase 84x384 (y 672; boards 8,
  16, 24 and 32 tiles up, under one-way-shelf rows 7 wide), lobby-sofa 120x72 (y 672; cushions 3 and 6 tiles up,
  under one-way-cushion rows 8 wide from x+12), lobby-desk 120x96 (y 672; its top 8 tiles up, under one-way-desk
  10 wide), lobby-plant 48x120 (y 672), lobby-lamp 48x192 (y 220, hung from the ceiling), lobby-window 96x240
  (y 552), lobby-front-door 156x180 (y 672: the inside of the front door, where she arrives; never a way back).
