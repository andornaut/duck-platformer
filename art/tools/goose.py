"""The countryside goose antagonist: a long-necked cream-and-grey bird, distinct from the round duck.

Usage, from the repository root:
  python3 -I art/tools/goose.py build
  python3 -I art/tools/goose.py preview OUT.png

Frame 48x48, facing right and mirrored for left, bottom centre (24,48). Standing feet occupy rows45..46
with their outline on47. All visible pixels remain inside the fixed hitbox (2,2,44,46), also when mirrored.
No red outline, portrait, clothing or story details are baked into this asset.

A narrow upright neck, small round head, cream feather mass with pale grey shade, grey wing and warm orange
bill/feet distinguish the goose from the duck. Warn raises a broad wing and the neck. Rush lowers the neck
forward into a short committed charge; rest is still lethal, never a safe state. No teeth or scary snarl.

Tags in frame order: idle 2x400ms; walk 4x120ms; warn 2x160ms; rush 4x80ms; rest 2x400ms.
All tags loop. These are art cycle defaults; gameplay owns state durations and all physical movement.
The build writes art/antagonists/goose-antagonist.aseprite and its PNG/JSON exports.
