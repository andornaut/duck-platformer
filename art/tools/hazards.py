"""Hazard sprites: the rolling traffic and the ferret's traps. The cellar hatch is tiles in tiles-street (floor1.py).

Usage, from the repository root:
  python3 -I art/tools/hazards.py build            write art/hazards/<key>.aseprite and
                                                   public/art/sprites/<key>.png + .json
  python3 -I art/tools/hazards.py preview OUT.png  contact sheet of every frame on slate, tan and cream

Every hazard takes an ink outline, so it holds 3:1 on every street ground, and is drawn at outdoor scale beside the
duck. A hazard restarts the floor on contact. Hit boxes are (x, y, width, height) in frame pixels for the facing
drawn, in HITBOX, and reach the manifest as "hitbox"; each box here is centred in its frame, so mirroring the sprite
does not move it.

frog-courier, 60x36: a frog courier on a delivery bike with a sky-blue cube bag on his back, facing right (the game
mirrors it for left). Rolls back and forth along the sidewalk. Tyres on row 34, outline on row 35 (the frame's bottom
row). Fills: green and dgreen (frog), sky, cyan and blue (bag), orange (frame), cream (eye), dslate and slate (wheel
disc and its turning bar, the slate ramp as steel; no grey). Hit box 6,6,48,30: the bike and the frog, leaving out
the top 6 rows (his eye bump and the bag's top) and 2px of each tyre's outer rim.

| Tag  | Frame | ms  | Pose                                                                      |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ride | 0-3   | 100 | pedals 90 degrees per frame, the knees following; wheel bars 45 per frame |
| idle | 0     | 400 | ride frame 0, for when he waits                                           |

The wheel bar turns 45 degrees (5.1px of tyre) per frame, so at 100ms the wheels roll without slipping at 51 px/s.

ferret-trap-snap, 50x26: the ferret's giant spring mousetrap. A wooden board (tan top, brown face) with a red
trigger pedal, a plum-and-red spring at the hinge, a white steel bar and, standing on the front end, the ferret's
badge. Board on rows 19 to 24, outline on row 25. Hit box 4,14,42,12: the board and the pedal, not the cocked
bar's tip or the badge's top. No hold-down arm: a 1px diagonal wire turns uneven at fractional scales, and the
cocked bar alone reads as armed.

| Tag  | Frame | ms  | Pose                                                       |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| set  | 0     | 400 | armed: the bar cocked back over the hinge                  |
| snap | 0     | 60  | sprung: the bar swinging up past vertical                  |
| snap | 1     | 60  | the bar halfway down towards the pedal                     |
| snap | 2     | 80  | the bar slammed flat on the pedal, the badge jolted 1px up |
| snap | 3     | 80  | closed: the bar flat, the badge settled                    |

snap plays once and holds its last frame (ONCE); set is one frame, so a still trap reads as still.

The badge (badge(), 13x13) is the ferret's calling card: a cream plate with his hat-and-bow mark (emblem(), 7x11:
a plum stovepipe with a red band over a red bow tie). Every trap the ferret sets carries it.
