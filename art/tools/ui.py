"""UI art: the dialogue box, choices, quip strip, touch buttons, start screen and cards, at the 720x360 base resolution.

Usage:
  ui.py build             write art/ui/<key>.aseprite and public/art/sprites/<key>.png + .json, list them in the
                          manifest
  ui.py preview OUT.png   a contact sheet of every frame

Run from the repository root. Text is never baked in: the game sets it with font-body or font-title at 2x. A text
origin below is a BitmapText's top-left at scale 2, and A is the text's advance width at 2x (the sum of xadvance,
doubled). Positions are in base pixels, top-left of the frame, matching the layout in art/README.md.

Nine-slice textures carry their margins (left, top, right, bottom) as an Aseprite slice named after the key and as
"slice" in the manifest entry. Single-state art has one tag, "rest", at 100ms. The touch buttons' press tag
plays once and holds its last frame (the manifest's "once") until the game shows the held tag; every other tag
loops.

Dialogue
- ui-dialogue-box, 640x96, at 40,256. Navy, ink border with cut corners, slate rim top-left, dslate bottom-right.
  Body text cream, origin 128,268, 504 wide, lines every 20.
- ui-portrait-frame, 68x68, at 48,270. Recessed dslate well; the 64px portrait goes at 50,272.
- ui-name-tab, nine-slice 12x20, margins 2,2,2,2; tags amber, green, pink, tan (the fill; one per speaker). Drawn
  A+12 wide at 124,237, so its bottom row lies on the box's top border. Name ink, origin x+6, y 234.
- ui-forward-mark, 10x14, at 653,323 (centred in the 636,308,44,44 hit area). Tag idle: the triangle steps right
  0, 2, 3, 2px over 1800, 80, 160, 80ms. Reduced motion shows frame 0.
- ui-skip, 78x20, at 634,8 (hit 634,8,78,44). Tags normal, pressed (dslate, rim inverted), disabled (flat, no
  rim, the double chevron becomes a bar). Label SKIP origin 643,5: cream, or grey when disabled.
- ui-answer, 208x36, hit 208x44 from row top y 192, so the art sits at y 196, 8 apart. Three at x 40, 256, 472
  (spanning the box); two at x 148, 364. Tags normal (dslate), selected (cream with an ink cursor), pressed (tan
  with the cursor). Text origin x+19, y 205, at most 166 wide: cream when normal, ink otherwise.

Quip
- ui-quip-strip, nine-slice 12x24, margins 2,2,2,2. Drawn An+Ab+24 wide (An the name, Ab the line), at most 452,
  centred on x 360 at y 8 (within 138..590). Name in font-title in the speaker's tab colour, origin x+9, y 7;
  line cream in font-body, origin x+15+An, y 11.

Touch controls (two round buttons for the right thumb, a pause button at the top left and the move hint at the left)
- Positions here are the base 720x360 layout as drawn. At runtime the game keeps every control inside the game's
  view across, ui-pause at the view's top and Use, Jump and the move hint at the screen's bottom, and sizes their
  press areas (src/layout/hitAreas.ts). Each drawn edge sits at least 8px from the edge it is placed against.
  Jump's ring is 8px in from the right and 20px up from the bottom, and the pause disc 8px in from the top and left.
- ui-touch-use, 75x75, centre pixel 37,37: top-left 561,166 for the centre 598,203.
- ui-touch-jump, 75x75, centre pixel 37,37: top-left 638,266 for the centre 675,303, towards the bottom-right
  corner, with Use above and to its left.
- Each is the move hint's open ring, 73px across with no face: a 2px cream band between 1px ink lines, with its icon
  centred in 2px strokes and fringed in ink, so it reads on any ground: three round dots (25x7) on Use, their top
  3px above the centre, and a caret (21x11) on Jump, its top 5px above. No label. Tags rest (100ms); press, once
  (frame 0 the band and icon turn white and the ring swells 1px; frame 1 the same at rest size; 60ms each); held (as
  press frame 1, 100ms).
- ui-pause, 35x35, centre pixel 17,17: top-left 7,7 for the centre 24,24, its disc 8px in from the top and left. A disc 33px
  across: an ink edge, a 2px cream ring (3px pressed) and a navy face (dslate pressed), with two pause bars (11x13,
  each 4 wide, 3 apart) centred on the centre; no label. Tags as for Use and Jump: rest; press, once (2 frames at
  60ms, frame 0 swells 1px); held.
- ui-move-hint, 75x75, centre pixel 37,37: a drawing only, with no press area. An open ring 73px across with no
  face, a 2px cream band between 1px ink lines, and a 2x chevron (8x10) each side, 22px from the centre, fringed in
  ink, so it reads on any ground, sky, character or prop. At rest its centre is level with Jump's and its ring as far
  in from the view's left as Use's is from its right: centre 121,303 (top-left 84,266) at 720 wide.
  While a touch moves her, the game draws it centred on that touch's neutral point (where the drag began), anywhere
  on screen, and puts it back on release. Tags rest; held-left and held-right (the dragged side's chevron white);
  one frame each.
- ui-move-knob, 11x11, centre pixel 5,5: a 9px knob fringed in ink, drawn on the hint's centre and offset by the
  drag's distance from its neutral point, left or right, capped at 12px. Tags rest (cream), held (white).

Button labels
- Every button's label is font-body at 2x, mixed case ("Start", "Resume", "Continue", "Install"), set by the game.
  It is centred on the button: origin x = the button's centre x - floor(ink width / 2), where the ink width is the
  label's visible width (advance - 2). Start, Resume and Continue lead with ui-play-mark: the mark, a 6px gap and
  the label's ink are centred as one group by the same rule, the mark at the group's x and the label's origin 11 to
  its right. Origin y is fixed per button, below; the label and the mark sink 2px while pressed.
- ui-play-mark, 5x10, one tag, rest: the ink play triangle, its top 4 rows below the label's origin y.

Start screen (720x360, over the street)
- ui-nav-bar, nine-slice 12x48, margins 1,1,1,3: a navy band ending in a slate line over an ink line, drawn
  720x48 at 0,0.
- ui-icon-button, 36x36, tags normal and pressed (the face sinks 2px): an ink line with cut corners, a dslate face
  with a slate top highlight on a navy lip. Its 20x20 icon goes at button + (8,6), or (8,8) pressed. With Exit:
  Settings at 632,6 (hit 628,2,44,44, icon 640,12) and Exit at 676,6 (hit 672,2,44,44, icon 684,12). Without Exit
  (Firefox for Android's installed app): Settings at 676,6 (hit 672,2,44,44, icon 684,12).
- Nav icons, 20x20: icon-settings-nav (the cog), ui-quit's normal frame (Exit: the doorway and arrow) and
  icon-home-nav (the house).
- ui-start, 192x52, tags normal and pressed: Resume's green button, larger. With the logo (public/art/logo.png at
  180,60) Start sits at 264,268; without it at 264,178. Label origin y = Start's y + 15, ui-play-mark's top y + 19:
  "Start" puts the triangle at x 338 and the label at 349.

Pause card, settings card and install steps card (each over the game dimmed two ramp steps, one at a time)
- ui-settings-card, nine-slice 16x16, margins 2,2,2,2: an ink border with cut corners round an lgrey face (pale
  steel), a white rim on the top and left and a grey rim on the bottom and right; no header. Every card is
  drawn 368 wide at 176,88. Title ink in font-title (11.0:1 on lgrey), centred on x 360: origin x = 358 minus
  floor((A - 4) / 2), where A is its advance width at 2x, origin y 96.
- ui-close, 24x24, at 510,94 (hit 500,88,44,44), the card's top right, on every card. Tags normal (ink X), pressed
  (white X on dslate).
- A settings row has no art, as on dog-walker-game's settings card: a 352x48 hit area at x 184 holding its 16x16
  icon at 198,y+16, its label (font-body, ink) at origin 228,y+15 and, for a toggle, ui-switch at 496,y+16.
- Pause card, 368x236, title "Paused": three buttons 352x48 at x 184, 4 apart: Resume (ui-button-primary) at y 136,
  Settings at y 188 and Back to title at y 240 (ui-button). Labels centred, origin y = button y + 13.
- Settings card, title "Settings": 368x236 with the Install row, 368x184 without it. Rows: "Move controls" at
  y 136 (icon-move-controls) and "Action buttons" at y 188 (icon-touch-controls), each with ui-switch, both on by
  default; Install at y 240, only while the app is installable (icon-install; ui-button drawn 72x28 at 452,250,
  centred on x 488, label ink, origin y 253; room 56). The build label, dslate in font-body (5.83:1 on lgrey), for
  example "v0.0.1 · dev", is centred on x 360 with its origin 28 above the card's foot: y 296, or 244 without
  Install.
- Install steps card, 368x160, title "Install". Two steps, each a 16x16 glyph and up to two lines of ink
  font-body at a 20px pitch, room 296: step 1's glyph (icon-ios-share on iOS, icon-browser-menu where the browser
  installs from its menu) at 198,145, text origin 228,144; step 2's glyph (icon-install) at 198,197, text origin
  228,196.
- ui-focus, nine-slice 16x16, margins 4,4,4,4: the keyboard focus ring, a 2px yellow band between 1px ink lines with
  cut corners. Draw it at (x-4, y-4, w+8, h+8) round the focused element's hit area or face: a row (360x56, the
  Install row included), Resume (168x52), Start (200x60), an answer (216x44), a nav button (44x44) or the close
  X's 24x24 mark (32x32). One tag, rest.
- ui-switch, 32x16, dog-walker-game's switch: an ink-rimmed track with a white knob, at the right with a white tick
  on dgreen when on, at the left with a white cross on slate when off, so the state reads by knob side and glyph as
  well as colour. Tags on, off.
- ui-quit, 20x20: the doorway with an arrow leaving it, the nav's Exit icon. Tags normal (cream), pressed (white,
  the arrow 2px further out).
- ui-button, nine-slice 16x28, margins 2,4,2,6: the secondary button, dog-walker-game's shape with no outline and
  cut corners: a grey face, one step darker than the card, with an lgrey highlight on its top row and a slate lip
  4px deep. Label ink (6.39:1 on grey). Tags normal, pressed (the face sinks 2px and the lip is gone, so its label
  moves down 2).
- ui-button-primary, nine-slice 16x28, margins 2,4,2,6: the primary button, ui-button's geometry, tags and press in
  dark steel: a dslate face, a slate highlight and a navy lip. Label white (9.55:1 on dslate).
- 16x16 row icons, one tag, rest: icon-settings (a cog: four 4x2 teeth on the axes and four 2x2 on the diagonals
  round a ring with a round hole), icon-home (dog-walker's solid house: a 1:1 pitched roof, a chimney on the right
  slope and a door gap, cream with tan on its lower-right edges), icon-exit (ui-quit's doorway and arrow, 12 rows
  tall), icon-touch-controls (a round touch button with the Jump caret), icon-install (an arrow down into a tray),
  icon-ios-share (Safari's Share button), icon-browser-menu (three stacked dots) and icon-move-controls (the move
  hint in small: a round ring with a chevron each side). All but icon-home are flat dslate in 2px strokes (5.83:1
  on the card's lgrey).
- ui-resume, 160x44: a green button with the play mark, the map's Continue at 280,300 (the hit area; art/tools/map.py
  places its label). Tags normal, pressed (the face sinks 2px into its lip).
