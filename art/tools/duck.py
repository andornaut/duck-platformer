"""The duck: the protagonist's sprite and her dialogue portrait.

Usage, from the repository root:
  python3 -I art/tools/duck.py build            write art/duck/<key>.aseprite and public/art/sprites/<key>.png + .json
  python3 -I art/tools/duck.py preview OUT.png  contact sheet of every frame on slate, tan and cream

Design: a wide, round cream blob of a duck with a small round head set into the top of her body at the front,
a square ink dot eye, a short plain orange bill, a flat tan wing patch and tiny orange stub feet. Her back dips
at the nape, so her round head sits up above the back line, and ends in a short tail tip at the rear. Cel
shading: a tan crescent on the lower right and a white rim on the upper left. Dark-slate outline. Facing
right (the game mirrors her). No bow.

duck, 48x42. Collision body 24x36 (2x3 tiles of 12px), anchored bottom-centre: the frame's bottom edge sits on
the body's bottom edge, and her body-centre x, 24 (the frame's centre line, between columns 23 and 24), sits on
the body's centre, so mirroring her does not move it. Feet on rows 39 and 40, the outline on row 41. The 24x36
body covers columns 12 to 35 and rows 6 to 41. At rest her back and tail overhang it 8px on the left and her
head and bill 10px on the right, and she stops 2px below its top. The raised wing overhangs up to 5px above
(flutter 0); the jump crouch and land squash push her tail out to 11 and 12px on the left.

Lift is how far the body's bottom edge sits above its rest row, in pixels. Body w x h is the body's
superellipse; normal locomotion keeps its area within 2% of rest. Shadow w is for a ground shadow the game
may draw under her: the land contact frame's is the largest. flutter and jump 1 are airborne, so their shadow
is the game's to place. jump, land and death play once and hold their last frame (the manifest's "once"); every
other tag loops. After land, play idle. Death is appended after the existing tags; frame indices stay fixed.
Death has no baked world movement: the runtime uses frame 0 for recoil, holds frame 1 during the physical fall,
then shows frame 2 on support and springs back to seated frame 3, held while the retry card is open.
The camera stays fixed. Durations above are art playback defaults; gameplay owns state timing and falling behaviour. The death
impact briefly compresses the body; the final pose is a full, round sit with a short flat belly centre
and rounded contact ends, resting on the frame bottom. Feet show during recoil and fall, not on support.
The body-centre and frame-bottom anchor do not move.

States: idle idle; move walk, and in the air jump, flutter and land; react none, falls back to land (its squash
reads as a flinch); death death; talk none, falls back to idle (the portrait carries the speech); quirk none.

portrait-duck, 64x64: her head and the top of her body, facing right towards the text, cut off by the frame's
bottom edge, on a transparent ground (the dialogue box's 68x68 frame supplies the backing), with one ink outer
line. Tags: neutral (dot eye), happy (eye closed in an upward arc), worried (dot eye under a brow slanting down
to the back, the bill a little lower). One frame each.
