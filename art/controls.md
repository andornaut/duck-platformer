# Form controls

The visual and interaction contract for ordinary buttons and selection controls. All measurements are base pixels in the 720x360 view. See [the art plan](README.md) for the drawing pipeline and [the rulebook](../gameplay/design.md) for game behaviour.

Status means **implemented**, **approved target** (a decision awaiting implementation), or **proposed** (requires a decision). Proposed values are not implementation instructions. This document records the target contract; it does not change runtime controls.

## Scope and exceptions

Apply this guide to menu actions, modal actions and ordinary form controls. A primary action keeps the same colour and geometry wherever it appears; disabled is a state, not another action role.

| Control                        | Reason for exception                                     | Retained rules                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compact Install action         | A 28px action sits within a full-height settings row     | Full 48px row target; compact content padding must still fit the shared font |
| Icon-only navigation and close | Compact, recognisable action without a text label        | Consistent icon placement, accessible action name, focus and press area      |
| Movement hint and knob         | Continuous directional input rather than a form action   | Contrast and clear state indication                                          |
| Pause, Use and Jump            | In-game controls must remain visible over varied scenery | Contrast, adequate press area and consistent press feedback                  |

A new exception names its concrete purpose and retained rules in this table. Placement alone does not justify another button style.

## Design tokens

Palette names refer to [palette.json](../public/art/palette.json). Colours are opaque; disabled controls do not become translucent.

| Name            | Value                       | Unit            | Purpose                                    | Status                                                           |

## Sizing and spacing

A texture's nine-slice margins preserve its corners and are not content padding. Keep face dimensions, content padding, gaps and expanded press areas separate.

Vertical content is centred within the usable face, with the existing two-pixel press displacement. Do not shrink text to meet a size token: grow the button or reword its label. The compact Install exception uses its existing 8px horizontal inset rather than the standard 16px; the whole 48px row remains interactive. Standardizing height does not make every button equally wide; use a shared width within the same action group.

Start-screen Start and Continue use `ui-button-primary`, dslate with white labels, at 192x48. Restart uses `ui-button`, grey with an ink label, also 192x48. With saved progress, Restart is on the left at 164,268 and Continue on the right at 364,268; the row has an 8px gap and is centred under the logo. Continue remains the default action for keyboard activation. Their labels start 13px below the button top and sink 2px while pressed. They use the shared press and focus handling, without a play mark. The map pairs Back to title on the left, secondary grey with an ink label, with Continue on the right, primary dslate with a white label. Back to title is at 164,300,192,48 and Continue at 364,300,192,48, with an 8px gap. Neither uses a play mark. Continue is the first Tab stop and the default Enter or Space action before focus moves; arrows and A/D retain zone selection. The unused `ui-start` remains 192x52 in the asset catalogue. Card actions are 352x48; Install is 72x28 within a 352x48 row.

## Button roles and states

Primary and secondary buttons share one silhouette, cut corners and nine-slice geometry. Role controls colour; interaction state controls geometry and feedback.

| Role/state         | Fill                        | Label/icon | Border and highlight                       | Geometry                               | Status                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary, normal    | `dslate`                    | `white`    | No outline; `slate` highlight, `navy` lip  | Raised face                            | Implemented on cards and start screen; approved target elsewhere |
| Primary, pressed   | `dslate`                    | `white`    | Lip disappears                             | Face, label and icon descend 2px       | Implemented on cards and start screen                            |
| Primary, focused   | Normal or pressed primary   | `white`    | Shared yellow focus ring outside face      | Size unchanged                         | Implemented                                                      |
| Secondary, normal  | `grey`                      | `ink`      | No outline; `lgrey` highlight, `slate` lip | Same raised face                       | Implemented                                                      |
| Secondary, pressed | `grey`                      | `ink`      | Lip disappears                             | Same 2px displacement                  | Implemented                                                      |
| Secondary, focused | Normal or pressed secondary | `ink`      | Shared yellow focus ring outside face      | Size unchanged                         | Implemented                                                      |
| Any role, disabled | `lgrey`                     | `dslate`   | Flat face, no outline or raised lip        | Same outer size; no press displacement | Approved target                                                  |

A disabled action retains its label and layout but cannot activate. The disabled face is pale steel (`lgrey`, `#c0cbdc`), with dark steel (`dslate`, `#3a4466`) text at 5.83:1 contrast. Primary is dark steel with white text; secondary is grey (`#8b9bb4`) with ink (`#181425`) text. Its flat silhouette distinguishes it from a raised secondary action without relying on colour alone. Ordinary buttons have no approved hover-specific visual treatment; hover must not change their size or role colour.

Dialogue Continue and Skip use the ordinary primary and secondary button styles, respectively, at 192x48 with an 8px gap. Required dialogue choices use ordinary buttons on a modal card rather than the legacy `ui-answer` artwork.

## Labels and icons

- Centre the visible label ink, not its font advance. At 2x, `font-body` visible width is advance minus 2px.
- Centre a leading icon, its gap and the label as one group. Preserve the same horizontal content inset on both sides of that group.
- Keep labels mixed case, short and consistent for the same action. The game supplies words; do not bake text into textures.
- Maintain at least 4.5:1 label contrast and 3:1 for essential marks. Use an icon colour suited to the face, rather than reusing a dark icon on a dark primary button.

The current ink `ui-play-mark` is unsuitable for a dslate face. A light variant or a tintable equivalent is required before restoring that mark on primary actions.

## Selection controls

Checkboxes, radio buttons and switches share this specification structure. Their semantics differ; do not replace one with another solely to reuse available art.

| Control      | Value semantics                                       | States                                                        | Drawn size | Label and placement                                           | Press area         | Keyboard                                          | Status                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Checkbox     | Independent boolean selection, usually part of a form | Unchecked, checked, focused, disabled; mixed only if required | 16x16      | Visible adjacent label; whole labelled row activates          | Shared target rule | Space toggles focused choice                      | Approved target; no current asset   |
| Radio button | Exactly one selection in a named group                | Unselected, selected, focused, disabled                       | 16x16      | Visible adjacent label; whole labelled row activates          | Shared target rule | Arrows move/select within group; Space selects    | Approved target; no current asset   |
| Switch       | Independent boolean setting applied immediately       | Off, on, focused, disabled                                    | 32x16      | Existing row: icon, label, switch; whole 352x48 row activates | Whole row          | Existing settings focus navigation and activation | On/off implemented; disabled target |

The switch uses knob position and a glyph: right with a tick for on; left with a cross for off. Off is an available value and must never look disabled. Checked and selected likewise remain separate from enabled and disabled.

## Interaction and accessibility

- Activating a disabled control has no effect. Keyboard navigation skips disabled controls; their labels remain visible.
- Focus is independent of pressed, selected and checked. Never remove the shared focus ring because a control is already coloured.
- On existing menus, Tab and arrows move focus; Enter and Space activate the focused action. A held key does not repeatedly activate an action.
- Open modals receive input exclusively. Outside taps follow the modal's close behaviour and never activate a control underneath.
- Overlapping expanded press areas choose the nearest control centre. Keep drawn faces and labels visually separate even where their press areas meet.
- Selection controls require visible labels; icon-only exceptions require an unambiguous action name. Exposing those names to assistive technology is a runtime requirement, not something a PNG supplies.

## Review checklist

1. Compare the control in its real menu or modal, in normal, pressed, focused and disabled states.
2. Check matching face sizes, content insets and gaps across the action group.
3. Verify labels fit at the shared font size, with icons centred as part of the group.
4. Check contrast in colour and greyscale, and check at fractional phone scale.
5. Confirm enabled state, selected value and keyboard focus remain distinguishable.
6. Confirm keyboard and touch activation use the same action and disabled controls cannot activate.
7. Record any exception and its concrete reason rather than introducing an undocumented style.

## Open decisions

None for the standard colours, dimensions, spacing or disabled navigation defined here. New bespoke controls require an explicit exception and a contextual review before implementation.

Remaining implementation: provide a light primary play mark, add disabled states and supply checkbox/radio assets when implementing forms. The asset and code contract above records these gaps.
