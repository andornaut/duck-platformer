// Every zone is 60 rows, starts on the ground at the bottom left and exits in the upper screen
// on the right. Each solid runs down to the bottom row, so every gap is a pit she falls out of.
// Rises and gaps are in tiles, from the top of the ground she leaves to the top of the ledge she
// lands on: a tap rises 1, a full jump 6, and a running jump crosses 18. Every mover's path is 2
// tiles from every solid and every other mover's path, so a mover never meets her box where she
// stands at an edge. Every gap she must not jump, a mover's gaps among them, is 19 or more across,
// counting the speed she keeps from a mover she leaves.
