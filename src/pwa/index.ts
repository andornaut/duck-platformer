// The game as an installed phone app: offline play and updates, the back gesture, the screen
// wake lock and persistent storage. setupPhoneApp runs once from main.ts; the scenes listen for
// PHONE_EVENTS on window and call the functions below.
//
// Offline play registers the service worker (serviceWorker.ts) and follows the kit's update
// flow. The game page is the only screen, so it counts as the home screen: a newer version takes
// over at once before the player has interacted, and after that an ordinary game modal offers
// it. The flow checks on each load and when the page comes back into view (an installed app
// resumed without relaunching). The game loads meanwhile:
// only its first screen and any save wait for the check (launchReady).
